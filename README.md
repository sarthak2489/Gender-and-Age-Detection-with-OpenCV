# Gender-and-Age-Detection-with-OpenCV

In this project, we will be coding a Gender and Age Detection with OpenCV. It will be enough to work for both the images or the video, for the same, we will be using OpenCV for doing all the image processing operations and can approximately guess the gender and age of the person (face) in a picture using Deep Learning on the Adience dataset.

For this we will have to install OpenCV library in Python through cmd
python --version

To check if PIP is already installed on your system, just go to the command line and execute the following command:
pip -V

To install OpenCV, just go to the command-line and type the following command:
pip install opencv-python

To check if OpenCV is correctly installed, just run the following commands to perform a version check:
python
import cv2
print(cv2.__version__)
