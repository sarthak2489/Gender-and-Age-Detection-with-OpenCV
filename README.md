# Gender-and-Age-Detection-with-OpenCV

In this project, we will be coding a Gender and Age Detection with OpenCV. It will be enough to work for both the images or the video, for the same, we will be using OpenCV for doing all the image processing operations and can approximately guess the gender and age of the person (face) in a picture using Deep Learning on the Adience dataset.

For this we will have to install OpenCV library in Python through cmd

python --version
pip -V
pip install opencv-python

To check if OpenCV is correctly installed, just run the following commands to perform a version check:

python
>>>import cv2
>>>print(cv2.__version__)
